Overall thoughts:
- TLDR: Great book that could've been 25 pages
- It's really ironic that a book about *subtraction* would be so filled with fluff
- There are really interesting ideas here, but I honestly think everything can be summarized in 1-2 paragraphs and there would be nothing of value lost
- The conclusions were really thought-provoking and got me to reflect on tasks as simple as picking out my favourite passages to place in this file
- Many of my initial picks had overlapping/repeated ideas--indeed, I could've subtracted without losing value
- What I'm trying to say is that I don't make the "best" or "most optimal" decisions in terms of concision/succinctness/efficiency. But it's really quite amusing to me that the author, who has stated that he's spent tens of thousands of hours researching this topic, still repeats himself so much and adds so many seemingly pointless side stories 
- The book's TLDR: consider the option of subtraction
